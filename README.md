# Hi there!

☺️🫂 Thanks for checking out my profile!

🏫🛌 I'm currently an undergrad student at PolyU HK, and with a stupidly high workload, this README won't see much meaningful updates for the foreseeable future.

☺️🧑‍💻 I don't know much, so I am always learning new technology. When I have free time, I contribute to Open Source for software I use, mostly in the form of bugfixes.

🌐🖥️ Come check out [my ☺️site](https://wesl.cc)!
