# Hi there! 👋☺️💬

☺️🫂 Thanks for checking out my profile!

🏫🛌 I'm currently an undergrad student at PolyU HK in my final year of study.

💻✨ Stuff I'm working at the moment (they're projects related to school, I haven't found time to work on personal projects yet):

  - 🤖🏎️ Robotics with ROS2 on Jetson Orin Nano & Object Detection with YOLO (for IC382 Multidisciplinary Manufacturing Project)
  - 🖼️🧐 Digital Forensics Analysis / Image forgery detection using Benford's Law (my Final Year Project)
  - 🧑‍💻🐒 Being an amateur code monkey for [PolyU English Learning Centre](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/elc/)

☺️🧑‍💻 I don't know much, so I am always learning new technology. When I have free time, I contribute to Open Source for software I use.
